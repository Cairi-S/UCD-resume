BUG REPORT:
Initially had issue getting the image to load.  I am unsure how I fixed the bug but think it was by deleting and re-downloading the file.

I have two rogue symbols at the top of my page (">) I have checked the code but can't see where the issue has come from.  In a full project I would take the time to fix this fully.
